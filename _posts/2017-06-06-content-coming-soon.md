Welcome to Donald's blog! Since I just made it a few days ago, there isn't a lot of content here yet, but I'm planning to write some posts over the next few weeks.

To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, I'll likely post about topics in these areas:

1. Machine learning
2. Programming Languages
3. Swift
4. iOS Development / Apple stuff
5. Math
6. Music
7. Martial Arts

Stay tuned for lots of exciting content!
